**I am a huge HUGE movie fan** My favorite film is *Casablanca*, becuase it's just the greatest love story in the world. The three reasons why are becuase...
1.The actors are amazing
2. The sound is wonderful
3. Its beautiful..

I am a big country music fan. One of my favorite bands are [Lady Antebellum](https://www.ladyantebellum.com/). This band's song, *Compass* awlays makes me cry. My favorite line is as follows: 
>So let your heart sweetheart, be your compass when your lost.
